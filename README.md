- 👋 Hi, I’m Nwankwo Emmanuel
- 👀 I’m interested in studying the impact of climate change on species community composition
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about climate change simulation in R
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on modelling the expected carbon emission target for each 10 degrees latitude window towards achieving the 2015 Paris Agreement. Specifically, what should be the contribution of societies within each 10 degrees latitude window to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
